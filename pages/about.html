            <p>
              This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
              Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
              society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
              Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
              science involves the study and development of applications that
              allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that
              support these applications, and the means and methods used to
              produce both applications and systems that behave reliably,
              correctly and ethically.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer
              programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect
              adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools
              and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the
              development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.The
              range of courses available in the department and the skills
              acquired by students enable them to find employment in many
              diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the
              computing industry, working in a project team (or research and
              development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist
              skills to that team
            </p>
            <p>
              The course also provides the platform for further study or
              research through exposure to established and emerging technologies
              and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer
              Science.The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes,
              Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and
              Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in
              Information Technology.
